# JavaScript.info Revision Notes

Welcome to my JavaScript revision repository based on the comprehensive material from [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/). As a frontend engineer focused on building scalable, real-time web applications, I’m revisiting the fundamentals and advanced concepts of JavaScript to solidify my core understanding and improve engineering depth.

## 📌 About Me

I’m a frontend developer currently working at **TARS INDUSTRIES**, building complex projects using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Redux**, **WebSockets**, **Turborepo**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**. With production experience in microfrontend architecture and full-stack integrations, I am revisiting JavaScript internals to strengthen my fundamentals for architecting better solutions.
